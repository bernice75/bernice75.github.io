# Welcome to my corner of the web.

Hey, I’m Scott Mathson. Fellow maker, small business owner, and entrepreneur.

For the past decade-plus, I’ve been building, marketing, and growing businesses, and their products, content, and presence. From my Mathson Design Co. consulting, to in-house roles at enterprise tech companies, to working one-on-one with fellow creatives and small businesses, I thrive on variety as well as breadth and depth in specific areas.

Western Montana is home, where I happily work remotely and enjoy time outdoors. This is my personal site and blog - a collection of articles, songs, musings, and journaling, as well as a [portfolio of my work](https://scottmathson.com/portfolio/).
